Getting Started with R: Kaggle's Titanic Competition

There are 4 excellent tutorials of which we know for using the software R to compete in the Titanic competition. These were created by members of Kaggle's community... We sincerely thank them!

1) DataCamp created this free, interactive tutorial intended for those new to machine learning and R. No local environment needed to get started and make your first submission!

2)Trevor Stephens created this guide which is intended for people with zero experience in R, and probably very little programming experience as well. For his great introduction, see this link:

3)Brian Liou posted this tutorial, also for people with little or no programming experience:  Data Analytics for Beginners: Part 1, Part 2 and Part 3.

4)Curt Wehrley created another in-depth explanation of one approach also using R:
